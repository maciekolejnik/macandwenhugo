##### 18th January 2020 (Saturday)

As most of our readers surely know, United Kingdom in not the sunniest place on the planet. Amount and frequency of rainfall differs greatly between areas, ranging from an unimpressive 580mm of average annual precipitation in London (with a little over 100 rainy days per year on average) to 3500mm (and more than 220 wet days) in a [small village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seathwaite,_Allerdale) in Lake District. To put that in context, Rome gets on average 800mm of rainfall per year, for New York it's over 1100mm, Paris is 640mm, Berlin - 590mm, and finally, Barcelona - 640mm. Sure, European cities with lower annual rainfall than London do exist, take Madrid (436mm) or Athens (365mm!) as examples, but, on the whole, the numbers don't exactly fit the rainy reputation most of us hold of London. 

Is it a stereotype then? Probably. The truth, however, lies somewhere in the middle. Thing is, rain in London, and more generally, in the whole of UK, is almost always very weak. Rarely anything more than a drizzle, really. What this means in practice is that it takes a lot of rain-hours to fill the yearly 580mm. Especially between October and March, there aren't many days without rain. However, it's also rare that it would pour all day. Typically, it's a mixture of overcast, rain and sporadical sunny periods, and switching between these states may occur multiple times on a given day. Forget a cold and crisp winter day, snow blanket covering the ground, sun shining low on the horizon. Instead, bring a raincoat and wellies and brace for a gloomy, cloudy day. Having said that, summers are usually quite dry and the temperatures very pleasant (at least in London). 

Alright, this post was supposed be about Bath, so why do we begin with this 'Climate of Britian 101'? Well, we are attempting to give you an idea of what a rarity it is to get a winter weekend full of sunshine, barely a cloud in the sky for two consecutive days. And that's exactly what happened on 18th and 19th of January in the year of 2020 AD. We took it as a sign from the universe - time for the first trip of 2020. Why Bath? Well, it's not too far from Windsor (2h drive), it's UNESCO listed, it's got the Roman baths and a few architectural landmarks. And, it was sunny.

## A brief history of Bath
The earliest evidence of human presence in and around Bath dates to Mesolithic period (roughly 10000 years ago). It is thought that the main hot spring (more about that later) had been discovered a while before the arrival of the Romans, and treated as a shrine by the Britons. It was only after the Roman conquest however that the site gained in significance. To celebrate the presence of miracolous hot springs, Romans built a temple, resulting in an influx of people and a development of a small settlement. Called *Aquae Sulis* back then, with the erection of *thermae* (Greek for large imperial bath complex) it soon became a spa town, where rich Romans would come to bath in 40+&deg;C water.

## Geothermal springs
Anyway, enough about the ancient history. It's time to address the elephant in the room - how come 45&deg;C water comes out of the ground in this random spot in Britian? And no, it has nothing to do with volcanic activity (In fact, there's no active volcanoes anywhere in the UK). So how is the water heated up, you may ask. Well, it turns out that the deeper underground you go, the warmer the rocks get. This intuitively makes sense given that the Earth's centre is about 6000&deg;C, but the pace of change might be surprising to some. Let's see, Earth's radius is 6371km, so we could expect an increase of 1&deg;C/km, right? Now, how deep underground can water travel? 5km? 10? Earth's crust is about 20km deep, so that should be an upper bound. It turns out that the *geothermal gradient* - a fancy name for the rate of temperature increase with depth on Earth - is about 25-30&deg;C/km. As we know from high school physics, heat is a form of energy, so where does this energy come from? One source is radioactive material stored inside the Earth, which releases constant stream of energy. Another is pressure from the rock above (with respect to gravitational force) - the deeper you go, the more of the earth is on top of you, and that pressure converts to energy. 

So the basic mechanism is this - water falls as rain on the neighbouring hills, seeps slowly 3-4km underground through a sort of sponge-like rock, absorbs energy as it comes in contact with warm rock and then, once it finds a fissure or a fault leading back towards Earth's surface, rapidly shoots upwards, driven by pressure, to finally emerge above the ground. It's a slow process - based on its chemical content, scientists have established that the water coming out of the ground today has fallen thousands of years ago. Any geologists out there, feel free to point out any inaccuracies in the above description. But that's roughly how it works.

Now a few practicalities. There's **no swimming** in the Roman Baths - the water contains harmful bacteria. However, it wasn't always that way. Bathing was allowed up until October 1978, when a young girl died of meningitis following immersion in the main pool. Today, bathing enthusiasts head to Thermae Bath Spa, a fancy spa complex that re-opened in 2006 after a major refurbishment. It will cost you an arm and a leg, but then it's the only natural hot spring in Britain. And the rooftop pool with views over the city looked delightful (We didn't go). Are the Roman Baths worth their price (roughly £15pp when we went)? Probably. It's quite well preserved, you get an insight into Romans' life,

## Mayor tour
Roman Baths is by far the most popular attraction of the city, but what else can you do? One idea is a free walking tour. And it's actually free - not the kind of 'leave a £10 tip at the end' free, but free free. It's run by local volunteers and they literally won't accept your money. They have a big knowledge of the city and its history, and can share that knowledge in an engaging way. Our recommendation: do it as the first thing of the day, to inform your future exploration and motivate you to an early start. And make sure you get the right tour to avoid disappointment; googling 'Mayor guides' should do the trick.

## Architecture

A big selling point of Bath is its architecture. Walking around the city is a treat - you're surrounded by uniform buildings constructued using creamy gold Bath stone, set in Georgian style. The emphasis is on symmetry, simplicity, proportion and balance - as seen in ancient Greece or Rome.
