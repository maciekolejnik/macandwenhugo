# DO NOT APPLY FOR THE BRITISH AIRWAYS VOUCHER, IT'S A TRAP

Before you apply for a Future Travel Voucher from British Airways, you should know the following things that the official website hides from you:

1. It's a voucher **not a e-voucher**, so you need to call the contact center to redeem it (expect long waiting hours)
2. They **charge extra** on top of the flight price for the services of booking with the voucher.
    - Let's say your voucher is worth 70 euros and you want to purchase a flight worth 55 euros. You'd think that the voucher would cover it but... it doesn't! They even ask you to pay 15 euros extra as the total price becomes 85 euros. In summary, **30 euros extra for the service charge from a 55 euros flight...**
3. **One voucher per trip.** Assuming that you might end up with multiple vouchers like us, you would hope to cover the remaining fee with another voucher but this is not possible.
4. The voucher is **non-transferrable.**
5. Also, you need to use your voucher for a flight trip that returns **within 12 months of your departure date of your cancelled flight**. It's not about your departure date, it's about your return otherwise you won't be eligible -- pretty good trick out there.
6. Lastly, it's very easy for your voucher to get lost among your endless BA emails -- make sure you keep them safe.

In summary,
### this is a voucher that is easy to get, easy to lose and hard to use.
So careful out there!

Let's be honest, British Airways has been very smart in here to keep the customers cash in their accounts. With this article we are trying to bring awareness of what they've done to loyal customers like us. We've tried to raise our voices (email, twitter, facebook...) but these were not heard. Our last resource is to warn you the customer not to apply for the voucher and get a refund instead. 

### You can get a refund by calling or sending a DM on Twitter up to 12 months after your cancelled flight date.
