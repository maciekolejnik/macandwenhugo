# DO NOT APPLY FOR THE BRITISH AIRWAYS VOUCHER, IT'S A TRAP

We have 3 vouchers and haven't been able to use them at all due to the following reasons:

1. It's a voucher **not a e-voucher**, so you need to call the contact center (good luck with that)
2. They **charge extra** on top of the flight price for the services of booking with the voucher.
    1. Let's say your voucher is worth 70 euros and you want to purchase a flight worth 55 euros. You'd think that the voucher would cover it but... NOT! They ask you to pay 15 euros extra as the total price becomes 85 euros = 55 euros **+** **30 euros of the service charge.**
3. I ask them if I can use my second voucher to cover the 30 euros service fee and... I CAN'T. **One voucher per trip.**
4. Lastly, the voucher is **non-transferrable.**

### Dear BA, I ask you to please solve this.
